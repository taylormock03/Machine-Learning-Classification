This is a test of different Machine Learning classification models that I am implementing from scratch. 

They will be tested against the "Adult" Dataset (also known as the "Census Income" dataset) which uses a set of 14 attributes to determine whether an individual's income exceeds $50k

Planned Models to implement:
    [] Linear Perceptron
    [] Decision Trees
    [] Random Forest
    [] Neural Network
